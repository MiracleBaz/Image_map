    Korattur Lake is a significant water body located in the Korattur area of Chennai, Tamil Nadu. The lake is a vital part of the local ecosystem and serves as an important natural resource for the region. Covering a substantial area, Korattur Lake is surrounded by residential areas, making it an integral part of the community, offering both aesthetic and environmental value.

    Historically, Korattur Lake was an irrigation tank and played an important role in the region's water management system. Over time, it has become a hub for biodiversity, supporting various species of birds, plants, and aquatic life. The lake also helps in flood control by acting as a natural catchment area during the monsoon season.

    Historically, the lake had been a significant feature for local biodiversity and was used for agricultural and recreational purposes. Over time, it faced pollution and encroachment issues, like many urban lakes in Chennai, due to rapid urbanization and industrial development. In recent years, efforts have been made to rejuvenate and conserve the lake to improve water quality, enhance biodiversity, and prevent further encroachment.
